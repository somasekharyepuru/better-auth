## Pricing Psychology

### Why $12/month?

| Competitor | Price | Positioning |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Todoist Premium | $5/mo | Basic task management |
| **Daymark** | **$12/mo** | **Complete daily system** |
| Motion | $19/mo | AI-powered (complex) |
| Sunsama | $20/mo | Heavy ritual-based |

**Strategic positioning:**
- 2.4x more than Todoist (justifies "complete system" vs "task list")
- 40% less than Sunsama (attractive to cost-conscious users)
- $12 feels like $10 psychologically (under $15 threshold)
- Annual saves $44 (encourages longer commitment)

### Annual Pricing Benefits
- **Monthly:** $12 × 12 = $144/year
- **Annual:** $100/year ($8.33/month equivalent)
- **Savings:** $44 or 31% off
- **Why it works:** Under $100 feels like impulse purchase territory

## Feature Distribution Rationale

### Free Tier Strategy
**Philosophy:** Give enough to build habit, limit enough to convert

**Why 3 priorities?**
- Research shows 3-5 is optimal for daily focus
- 3 lets users experience core value
- Wanting more = sign of engagement = ready to pay

**Why limit Pomodoro to 3 sessions?**
- ~90 minutes of focus time (enough to prove value)
- Users doing deep work daily will hit limit quickly
- Timer is key differentiator, so give taste but not full meal

**Why 2 Life Areas?**
- Lets users separate "Work" and "Personal"
- Experiencing organization value without full flexibility
- Natural upgrade path when they want "Health," "Learning," etc.

### Premium Tier Strategy
**Philosophy:** Remove all friction, unlock power tools

**Advanced Tools as premium:**
- Eisenhower Matrix: Strategic planning feature (power user)
- Decision Log: Specialized tool (not everyone needs)
- These justify "premium" label beyond just "more of the same"

**Multi-calendar sync:**
- Many professionals have work + personal calendars
- This is a B2B/professional signal
- Worth paying for if you need it
